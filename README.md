# Marvel Snap Bonus Boosters
### This script reads data from the game files stored in your device and gives you a list of all the possible cards in your collection that can be displayed in the Bonus Boosters section in the shop.
### To optimize this new feature, get the boosters for cards that are only missing a few of them playing normally so that they are removed from the rotation.
### This way you are more likely too see in the shop the cards that are missing the most boosters (bottom of the result list). These are the ones you should upgrade to get the most free boosters possible.

## How does it work?
### This script only reads data from the game files stored in your device. These files are visible to anyone and all the data is easily accessible with a simple file explorer tool.
### This is just a compiler to speed up the process so you don't have to search everything manually.
### The script does not export the data or edit it in any way. Everything is executed locally on your device.
### Note: You will need Python installed on your PC or an app that can run Python on your mobile.

## How to use it?
### In this git page, click on the green "Code" button, download the zip and extract it in your device. Then:
### PC: Execute file "GetCardList.py" (py .\GetCardList.py)
### Android: (Not working in Android 13 or more recent) If you are browsing on android make sure to select "Desktop Site" so you see the green "Code" download button. Then use an app (tested on Pydroid3) that let's you execute a Python file and execute file "GetCardList.py" (py .\GetCardList.py)
### iPhone: Not available.
